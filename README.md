# movie-information
This repository is a collection of programs that are specifically turned to how I interact with movies


At the moment, this is only a placeholder for an idea. Hopefully I will find enough free time
between class and looking for a job to make some cool scripts!

Ideas:
- Web scraper that gets all the showtimes around me from fandango's website and displays
  without giving any information about the movie (I like to know as little as possible before watching)
  Ideally I would be able to see only movie title, theater name, and ticket price
  
- Comparing that list of possible movies to movies I have already seen (grabbed from my letterboxd account
  using the letterboxd https api) 

- Shaving down that list of movies by automatically removing things I know I won't want to see
  (such as documentaries or kids movies) that way I can just see a title, theater, time and ticket price
  and not be exposed to any information about the movie
